  <h1>✨ A Love Without Borders</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Bienvenue • Bem-vindos • Welcome • Bienvenido</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Our story was written across oceans, cultures, and languages —</p>
  <p>a Black girl with boundless dreams,</p>
  <p>a Portuguese soul shaped by Europe,</p>
  <p>— two worlds meeting and choosing each other, again and again.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Now, we invite you to celebrate that love with us on the French Riviera.</h3>
  <br>
  <a href="{{ base.url }}/{{ page.lang }}/form" class="participate">Join us in Cannes, France</a>
  <br>
  <h3>for a weekend of beauty, meaning, and magic.</h3>

  <p style="text-align: left;">This is more than a destination wedding.</p>
  <p>It is a tribute to heritage.</p>
  <p>To resilience.</p>
  <p>To faith.</p>
  <p>To love that crossed borders, accents, and expectations, and found home.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Your presence would mean everything to us.</p>
  <p>And still, there is absolutely no pressure.</p>
  <p>We honor every “yes,” every “not this time,” and every way you choose to support us.</p>
  <p>For those who cannot join us in France, we look forward to celebrating together in the U.S. in 2027.</p>
